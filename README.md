# N-gram Language Model
Done as a project during a Natural Language Processing Course
The original assigment was to create a bi-gram that used _Pride and Prejudice_ as the language model data. I did that, then made a few edits and made a tri-gram language model that used the combined texts of Dostoyevsky as the data.
